            I am a resident of Navi Mumbai, born and brought up here, after high school just like every other person I
            knew, picked up electrical engineering ...fast forward to 2018 I am working as an electrical design engineer
            at a local business after the initial excitement I always looked forward to weekends where I spent hours
            tinkering with javascript and rarely did anything else on weekends I absolutely enjoyed the process and the
            fascination of it still burns like a fire up to this day fast forward 1.5 years the pandemic hit & I got a
            brief period for myself to think clearly and there I made a decision to not never "work" again and to switch
            my career into something that is also my hobby i.e web development.
            <br>
            By the time I decided to switch my career all I had on my new resume is a couple of decent websites, a Udemy
            certificate and unusual past work experience in a different field that raised eyebrows. So it was clear I
            needed something to guide myself and learn web dev in a manner that was industry-ready so I resigned from my
            previous job & joined a Banglore based online web dev boot camp called Newton School where I learned React,
            git and other good stuff and I finally got placed in my first interview there, and from here began a new
            exciting chapter!
