            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>On one fine friday we were discussing about unbundling of features from super apps so what do i do
                saturay out of boredom? i deceide to code out a web that that is built around "bookmarks folder" and
                add social layer around it, for fun.
            </p>
            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>it is a website that lets u create a bookmarks folder that can be private with your own use, or u can
                make it public so people
                who are interested can follow your bookmarks folder, now u are the curator hence Qurate.
            </p>
            <h3>When?</h3>
            <p>Started in August 2021 took 25 days (in weekends) of efforts to code the entire thing out.</p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>Designed in figma | Front end is written in React.js, with SaSS for css | GraphQl for api's <br>
                Node.js and MongoDB for backend.| User verification and spam protection is handled in backend.
            </p>
            <h3>Where</h3>
            <p>Honestly its a project started for fun & to practice clean code writing and best practices, it will be
                put on the internet
                with no intension to persue it further with a fixed goal, but it will definitely have a very few
                enthusiastic users who
                happen to be my friends and collegues :p </p>
